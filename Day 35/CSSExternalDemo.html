    <h1>External Style Sheet</h1>
    <p id="idSelector">An external style sheet is ideal when the style is applied to many pages of the website.
       An external style sheet holds all the style rules in a separate document that you can link
       from any HTML file on your site. External style sheets are the most flexible because with
       an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one
       file.You can attach external style sheets in two ways â€” linking and importing.</p>
    <h2>Linking External Style Sheets</h2>
    <p>Before linking, we need to create a style sheet first. Let's open your favorite code editor and create a new file. Now type the following CSS code inside this file and save it as "style.css".</p>
    <p>An external style sheet can be linked to an HTML document using the <link> tag. The <link> tag goes inside the <head> section</p>
