            One particular book which is recommended reading is <u>The Street Lawyer</u> by <u>John Grisham</u>. This
            book is about a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad incident occurs
            within his law firm. Consequently, he becomes acquainted with the inner city streets, and realizes
            the harsh existence of the homeless, and vows to give them a chance in the courts. <u>The Street
            Lawyer</u> is a <i><b>great</b></i> book. It is <i><b>well written</b></i> and <i><b>interesting</b></i>.
