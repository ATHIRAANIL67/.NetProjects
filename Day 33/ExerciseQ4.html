        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>
            Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science 
            which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, 
            gradually improving its accuracy.

            IBM has a rich history with machine learning. One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is 
            credited for coining the term, “machine learning” with his research (PDF, 481 KB) 
            (link resides outside IBM) around the game of checkers. Robert Nealey, the 
            self-proclaimed checkers master, played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962, 
            and he lost to the computer. Compared to what can be done today, this feat seems 
            trivial, but it’s considered a major milestone in the field of artificial intelligence.

            Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. 
            Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications
             or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights 
             subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally 
             impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market 
             demand for data scientists will increase. They will be required to help identify the 
             most relevant business questions and the data to answer them.

        <h2>Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>
            Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. "Deep" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. Deep learning can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention required and enables the use of larger data sets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The “deep” in deep learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic neural network.
        </p>

            Deep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

        <h2>Supervised machine learning</h2>
        <p>
            Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).

        <h2>Unsupervised machine learning</h2>
        <p>
            Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.

        <h2>Semi-supervised learning</h2>
        <p>
            Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm. It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data.
